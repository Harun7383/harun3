    <b>Jeetendra Madnani </b>started his modeling career in 1993. His first acting assignment
     was Bishabriksha (1994–95), a Bengali TV series directed by Bishnu Palchaudhuri. 
     He made his big screen debut with Chandu (2001), a Telugu film. [7] His first success came in 2002,
     opposite Priyanka Trivedi, through Sathi, a highly successful romantic drama, 
     directed by Haranath Chakraborty, for which he won the Bengal Film Journalists' 
     Association Most Promising Actor Award and Anandalok Awards for Best Actor. In the same year, 
     he acted in the Bengali remake of Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar. <i>This initial success was followed by 
     other critical and commercial successes, including Nater Guru, Sangee, Bandhan and Yuddho.</i> 
     In 2005, he acted alongside Koel Mallick in Nater Guru, which released to critical and 
     commercial success and fetched him his second Anandalok Award for Best Actor. 
     This success was short-lived as Jeet starred in some commercial failures, including Saathihara,
     Priyotoma and Ghatak but this failure was short-lived as Jeet starred in Jor, which became a box office hit.<hr>
